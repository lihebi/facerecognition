LOW-RESOLUTION FACE RECOGNITION VIA SPARSE REPRESENTATION OF PATCHES(2013)
----accomplish an essay by Liansheng ZHUANG(2009)


I have written 2 versions of it, one using matlab and one using python. They are seperate, and do the same work.

Since I put codes in different directories with their data, and I just put the useful one together here in github, maybe you will find them confused. But at least I think you can get my programming style in them. ^_^
